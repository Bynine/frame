*SHRINE_BOOK
&quot;In this land of Wabika, there exists a legendary item that represents Hope.
It has the power to bring civilizations back from despair.
However, only those who both truly understand this land and truly need it will be able to obtain it.
It lies dormant within the Shrine, waiting for the worthy one who would claim it for their own.&quot;</property>
