How are ya, hon? It must've been bitter cold coming all the way here! Well, stay as long as you like and warm up.
Say, on your way here... [ANIM_4]You didn't happen to see Archibald, did you? My... friend, the artist you helped out earlier.
He went out a while back to look for supplies and I haven't seem him since.[ANIM_1] I sure hope he's doing okay.
I'd look for him myself [ANIM_4]but I need to keep this place warm and food available for all the people stuck here.
[ANIM_2]Speaking of which! Here, have a hot cocoa, on the house. 
[NOSPEAKER][COCOA_BEGIN][GIVE_COCOAHOT]You got the hot cocoa! Careful, it'll cool down before long.
[ANIM_4]And... please, let me know if you see him, okay, hon?

Ah, do you need your cocoa heated up? Don't worry about it, hon!
[NOSPEAKER][COCOA_BEGIN][GIVE_COCOAHOT]You got the hot cocoa! Careful, it'll cool down before long.

Archibald told me all about what you did! Oh, you are just the sweetest, you know that, hon? What would we do without you?
[GIVE_COFFEE]Here, have my strongest espresso on the house! Just a little sip and you'll have more zip than you'll know what to do with!
If you want to use it, just select it from your backpack, okay, hon?

Awww... I missed you so much, Archie-warchie...
You don't ever run off like that again, y'hear?
[SPEAKER=ARTIST]Of course, my dear... But please... that's a bit embarrassing...
