Brrrr... This cold isn't good for these old bones. 
Say, young one, have you seen Leslie around? 
I've seen various people come and go, but she seems to have left and not come back. I do worry about that girl.

I never know what's going on in her head...
Not that there's much going on in mine! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!
