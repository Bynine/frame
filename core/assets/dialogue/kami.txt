*TALK_KAMI
Why, hello there! Well done for making it this far, traveller from another land.
I'm sorry to say that right now, I do not have what you're looking for. This world is not complete yet.
Even my body is not done yet, as you can see... I am merely borrowing your image.
In time, your hard work will be rewarded. For now, this is all there is.
I hope to see you in the future, in my realized vision...

...I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work.
Creation is a hard task, you know!
