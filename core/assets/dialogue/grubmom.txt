Oh... thank goodness someone came.
Dear traveller... I am ever so sorry, but I must ask for your help.
My children... They ran off just as I began to pupate... And now they're lost out in the woods...
When they're afraid, they usually bury themselves under a tree...
If you could return them here... I would be forever indebted.
