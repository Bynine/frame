Dear traveller... NUM_GRUBS_STILL_LOST of my children AREIS s-still [ANIM_1]lost somewhere in the grove... 
[ANIM_0]Sniffle... When they're afraid, they usually bury themselves under a birch tree... It's their favorite kind, you see.
If there's any way you could return them here... You would make this awful mother so happy.

[NOSPEAKER]It's a cocoon.
[NOSPEAKER]A warm glow of appreciation seems to surround it.

Please, you must help... [ANIM_1]My poor babies...!
[ANIM_0]Not long ago, they heard the townsfolk talking about how a traveller had arrived...
S-so they ran out west to go see, and they haven't returned since... [ANIM_1]They must have gotten l-lost...
[ANIM_0]I want nothing more to go look for them myself, but as you see, I've begun pupating and now I can't move...
[ANIM_1]I feel wretched... What kind of awful mother can't help her children?!
