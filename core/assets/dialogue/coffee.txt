Maaaan, I sure do wish I could have a cup of delectable coffee...
[TALK]Huh? Whassat? You helped out Jackie and now she's free?
[SPEED=6]... [SPEED=2][ANIM_1]I have a confession to make.
[NSPEED]I don't actually like coffee. I just thought I'd sound cool if I complained a lot.
[ANIM_0]Well, either way, thanks for letting me know. Here's something for being a good kid.
[NOSPEAKER][CURRENCY_1]You were given an acorn!

Maaaan, I really wish I could go for a walk...
