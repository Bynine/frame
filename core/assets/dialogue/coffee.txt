[ANIM_2]Maaaan, I'm really itchin' for a cup of smooth, tasty coffee...
[ANIM_0]But the cafe isn't even open up yet...
[ANIM_2]Maaaan... What a pain!

[ANIM_2]Maaaan, I'm really itchin' for a cup of delicious coffee...
[ANIM_0]But Jackie's way too busy with all the customers that're already in there...
[ANIM_2]Maaaan... I want a cup of that smooth java...

[ANIM_2]Maaaan, I sure do wish I could have a cup of delectable coffee...
[TALK][ANIM_0]Huh? Whassat? [PAUSE]You helped out Jackie and now she's free?
... [PAUSE][SPEED=2][ANIM_1]I have a confession to make.
[NSPEED]I don't actually like drinking coffee. I just thought I'd sound cool if I complained a lot.
[ANIM_0]Well, either way, thanks for letting me know. Here's something for being a good kid.
[NOSPEAKER][CURRENCY_1]You were given an acorn!
&TALK_WANTCOFFEE
Hmm... I've been standing here complaining for so long my legs have fallen asleep.
[ANIM_2]Maaaan, I really wish I could go for a walk...[ANIM_0]

... Okay, I'm sure you're wondering why I'm still here.
... [PAUSE][SPEED=2][ANIM_1]I have another, even more secret confession to make.
I like the smell of the coffee, but not the taste. But if I go inside she might kick me out for not buying anything...
&TALK_WANTCOFFEE_2
Keep this a secret, okay? Just between us two.
And, uh... if you buy a coffee in there... [ANIM_1]Maybe waft a bit of the scent towards me?
[ANIM_0]I'd appreciate that.
