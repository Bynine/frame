Oh, now I remember... It's Barley! Yes, we had a lot of fun together, Barley and I! 
I remember one time, when we were young and playing store, I tried haggling down his prices...
He got so mad he turned red! Hahaha!
... I just remembered somebody else! Yeah, someone... Someone who really liked old books...
Who were they, again...?
&GHOST_LIBRARIAN
Oh my goodness, that's right! It's Codsworth!
We would spend hours just poring over old books, discovering the craziest things...
You know, that's how I found out about the Shrine.
Hang on, now I remember... There was one other good friend of mine...
I think ... they really liked red coffee?
That sounds weird, doesn't it. Maybe I'm remembering wrong?

[PAUSE]Leslie...
[NSPEED]That's right. I remember. Everything that happened, and...
[SPEED=2]I...[PAUSE] I miss them all, very much. [NSPEED]But at least my memories of good times have returned!
I think, with that, I finally feel at ease. Thank you so much, stranger.
It's not much, but take this, at least.
[NOSPEAKER][GIVE_TREASURE6]You were somehow handed an old plush doll!
That thing you're searching for... If you're as good of a person as I think you are, you'll find it.
I can only hope it meets your expectations.
Now it's time for me to go to the Kami. Best of luck to you, stranger!
