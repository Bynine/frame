I've seen some small stone statues in these woods. They give off a weird vibe.
Heck if I know what they're for, though. I'm just a beetle!

I wish I knew more about those little statues. 
But it's a miracle I can even speak. After all, I'm just a beetle!

Say, did you figure out what those little statues do?
I don't think I ever will. After all, I'm just a beetle!
And that's okay.

Being a beetle is nice, actually.
You get to do fun things, like wonder what little statues are, but never actually care to investigate.
It's enough to keep the mystery alive. Makes it feel more magical, you know?
Ahhh... Yes. That wonderful feeling of not knowing something. It's what makes people want to explore.
But not us. We're just beetles!
