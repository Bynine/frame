I have just awakened from what feels like a very long sleep.

>YES,NO
<YES
[TALK]...

I could sense that her heart was full of frustration. It is difficult to cope with loss.

Thank you, once again, traveller, for all that you've done.
<NO

Thank you, once again, traveller, for all that you've done.
