Welcome to Wabika. Looking for something in particular?
[TALK][PAUSE]...Oh, is that so...
Interesting. I gotta admit, I don't know much about that sort of thing.
But tell you what - try visiting my friend up northeast. They run a little book store.
I'll bet you anything they've got some old books on what you're looking for.
[ANIM_1]Good luck! Come again soon![ANIM_0]

Have you headed up northeast to the bookstore yet? I definitely recommend it.
Unfortunately, I don't have anything to sell right now, but feel free to look around.
And be sure to check back soon! I get new stuff in stock pretty often.
