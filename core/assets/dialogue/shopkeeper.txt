Hello there, stranger! Welcome to Wabika. Looking for something in particular?
[TALK][SPEED=5]...[NSPEED]Oh, is that so...
[NSPEED]Interesting. I gotta admit, I don't know much about that sort of thing.
But tell you what - try visiting my friend up northeast. They run a little book store.
I'll bet you anything they've got some old books on what you're looking for.
Good luck! Come again soon!

Hello again! Have you headed up northeast yet? I definitely recommend it.
Unfortunately, I don't have anything to sell right now, but feel free to look around.
