[ANIM_3]Welcome to Wabika, stranger! [ANIM_0]Looking for something in particular?
[TALK][PAUSE]...Oh, is that so...
Interesting. I gotta admit, I don't know much about that sort of thing.
But tell you what - try visiting my friend up northeast. He runs a little book store.
I'll bet you anything he's got some old books on what you're looking for.
[GIVE_MAP]Oh! And here's a map of Wabika. This should help you out.
[ANIM_1]Good luck! Come again soon![ANIM_0]

Have you headed up northeast to the bookstore yet? I definitely recommend it.
Unfortunately, I don't have anything to sell right now, but feel free to look around.
[ANIM_3]And be sure to check back soon! [ANIM_0]I get new stuff in stock pretty often.
