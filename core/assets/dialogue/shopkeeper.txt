[ANIM_1]Howdy there, stranger! [ANIM_0]Welcome to Wabika. Looking for something in particular?
[TALK][SPEED=6]...[NSPEED]Oh, is that so...
Interesting. I gotta admit, I don't know much about that sort of thing.
But tell you what - try visiting my friend up northeast. They run a little book store.
I'll bet you anything they've got some old books on what you're looking for.
Good luck! Come again soon!

Unfortunately, I don't have anything to sell right now, but feel free to look around.
And be sure to check back soon! I've always got new stuff in stock.
