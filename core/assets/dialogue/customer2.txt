[REMOVE_ITEM]Thank you, dearie.
You know, your outfit... It reminds me of the clothing of the people of a country I saw when I was young.
[LAUGH]Yes, that was a long time ago! Hahaha!
Back when I used to travel, I visited a country far to the west.
It was very beautiful... You should have seen it.
But these days, I hear it's destitute. I'm not sure what happened, but it's a real pity.
Either way, sorry to bore you with my old tales. [LAUGH]Hahaha!

Hrmm... I don't recall ordering that. Am I having a senior moment? [LAUGH]Hahaha!
