Hello there! You wouldn't happen to know how long my drink will take, would you?
I might turn into dust if I don't drink soon! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!

Hrmm... I don't recall ordering that. Am I having a senior moment? [ANIM_1]Hohoho!

[REMOVE_ITEM]Thank you, dearie.
You know, your outfit... It reminds me of the clothing people wore in a country I saw when I was young.
[ANIM_1]Yes, that was a long time ago! Hohoho!
[ANIM_0]Back when I used to travel, I visited a place far to the west.
It was very beautiful... You should have seen it.
But these days, I hear it's destitute. I'm not sure what happened. It's a real pity...
Either way, sorry to have bored you with this old man's ramblings. [ANIM_1]Hohoho!
<GHOST
[SPEAKER=GHOST_DIRT]...[PAUSE]Dude, he's old, not dead...
Hm? Is something wrong, child? [ANIM_1]Hohoho!
<OTHER
Hrmm... Why, I don't even think that's a drink! Are you playing a prank on me? Good one! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!
&GIVEN_ORDER2
Thank you again for the drink, dearie!
With those serving skills, you should work here full time! Jackie sure needs the help! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!

Say... you have a bit of a different look about you.
Like you've gained a bit of experience. [ANIM_1]Good for you! Hohoho!
Just don't get too experienced or you'll turn into an old crone like me! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!

Ahh, I'm glad it's warmed up again... I can't do much when it's cold!
If that went any longer I'd have turned into a popsicle! [ANIM_1]Hohoho!
