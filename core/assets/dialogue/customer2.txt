Hello there! You wouldn't happen to know how long my drink will take, do you?
I might turn into dust if I don't drink soon! [ANIM_1]Hahaha!

[REMOVE_ITEM]Thank you, dearie.
You know, your outfit... It reminds me of the clothing of the people of a country I saw when I was young.
[ANIM_1]Yes, that was a long time ago! Hahaha!
[ANIM_0]Back when I used to travel, I visited a country far to the west.
It was very beautiful... You should have seen it.
But these days, I hear it's destitute. I'm not sure what happened. It's a real pity...
Either way, sorry to bore you with this old man's ramblings. [ANIM_1]Hahaha!

Hrmm... I don't recall ordering that. Am I having a senior moment? [ANIM_1]Hahaha!
