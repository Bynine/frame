Ok, hon, here're the orders.
[GIVE_ORDER1][GIVE_ORDER2][GIVE_ORDER3][NOSPEAKER]You got handed the orders!
The latte with extra milk goes to the pretty lady over there with the purple coat...
The spiced pumpkin cider goes to that older gentleman right there...
And the red-bean coffee goes to Leslie over there, the one in the plaid shirt.
Got all that, hon?
