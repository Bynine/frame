[ANIM_1]You... who are you, exactly?
Yokey... yeah, I knew her. Very well. One day, in fact...
I remember seeing some person in armor, wearing a cape, walking toward that shrine that she was always around.
I thought it was weird, but I wanted to give her privacy. So I left them alone.
[PAUSE][ANIM_3]...That was a mistake.
[NSPEED]Nobody ever saw that warrior or Yokey ever again. They've disappeared to time.
And I could have stopped it.
...[PAUSE][ANIM_2]Ha. To be honest, it feels good to get that off my chest. I've been holding that in for a while.
[ANIM_2]Thanks, little guy. You're a good listener and a good waiter too.[ANIM_0]
