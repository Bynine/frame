[ANIM_1]Oh! Oh my goodness! Can you see me?!
[TALK][ANIM_0][SPEED=6]... [ANIM_1][NSPEED]You CAN?!
Wow!! This is so exciting!! I haven't talked to anyone in years!
How's it going? [SPEED=1]What's your favorite food? Do you like playing cards? 
[SPEED=0.5]Do you prefer green or black tea? Sunshine or rain? Gasp - do you like acoustic guitar? I love acoustic guitar!
[NSPEED][ANIM_0]Whew... Sorry...
Anyhow, if you can see me, I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.
Before I became a spirit, I used to have a lot of friends here. But it's been so long by now I've forgotten what they look like.
Is there any chance I could tag along with you? Maybe you can figure out who they are so I can find peace.
I promise I'm very lightweight!
>YES, NO
<YES

<NO
[ANIM_0]...
Boo... hoohoo...
