[ANIM_1]Howdy there, my friend![ANIM_0]
[TALK][SPEED=6]...[NSPEED]Oh? What's that?
Yokey... now there's a name I haven't heard in a while. She was one of my best friends as a kid.
I remember I would pretend to run a shop, selling stuff like pine cones and oak leaves...
And she would always come over and pretend to buy things. Kids are silly, huh? Haha.
[ANIM_2]... I really miss her. She disappeared a while back. I never found out what happened.
I hope wherever she is, she's doing all right.
[ANIM_0]Oh! Sorry. Didn't mean to talk your ear off. Have a great day, my friend!
[ANIM_2]...
