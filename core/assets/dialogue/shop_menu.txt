Care to buy -[TALK][PAUSE]...[NSPEED]Oh? What's that?
Yokey... [PAUSE]now there's a name I haven't heard in a while. She was one of my best friends as a kid.
I remember I would pretend to run a shop, selling stuff like pine cones and oak leaves...
And she would always come over and pretend to buy things. [ANIM_3]Kids are silly, huh? Haha.
[ANIM_2][PAUSE]... I really miss her. She disappeared a while back. I never found out what happened.
I hope wherever she is, she's doing all right.
[ANIM_0]Oh! Sorry. Didn't mean to talk your ear off. Have a great day, my friend!
[ANIM_2]...

So... It looks like you found what you were looking for.
Don't ask how I know. [ANIM_3]I can just see it in your eyes!
[ANIM_0]Still, you're always welcome here. You've done so much to make this place a better one.
[ANIM_3]Thank you... my friend.

How's it going? Sorry, I've still got nothing more to sell.
[ANIM_3]You really cleaned me out!
Say, you know that lady who was in here earlier, in the purple coat?
She and I had an adventure, a long time ago, far away from here. Back when I was just a kid!
We were all alone, at night. It was some scary stuff. You really should've seen it.
Ahh, memories...
