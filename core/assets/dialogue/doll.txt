Hey, wanna see something cool?
[PAUSE][RIP][ANIM_3][PAUSE]Tada!
...[PAUSE][ANIM_2]Seriously though, this really, really hurts.
See, I was running in the forest when my hair got caught in a tree branch, and, well... You can see what happened.
Say, do you suppose you could help out the tailor? I wanted to see her to get this fixed up, but she's got problems too.
Something about missing children? [ANIM_1]I'd head on over and help her myself, but, uh...
[ANIM_2]if I take any unnecessary steps I'm pretty sure this thing is falling right off.
[ANIM_1]And you really don't want me to lose my head! Hahaha... ha...
[ANIM_2][SOFT]Help...

Hey, any luck helping out the tailor?
No rush or anything. I'll just stand here, praying a strong gust of wind doesn't decapitate me.
[RIP][ANIM_1][PAUSE]...
[ANIM_2][SOFT]Please hurry...

[ANIM_1]Hey, look at me! Good as new, huh? The tailor fixed me right up!
[ANIM_0]Weren't you the one who brought back her kids? Good for you! Here, maybe this'll help you get a-head too!
[NOSPEAKER][CURRENCY_1]You were given an acorn!
[ANIM_1]Don't spend it all in one place! Or do, I'm not your boss.

Howdy, ol' buddy ol' pal! 
[ANIM_1]I gotta say, it's great to be able to move without worrying about spontaneous decapitation! This is the life!

Hi again, ol' buddy ol' pal! 
So, what're your plans? Are you head-ing off, or will you stay around?
[ANIM_1]Don't go too far, now... Who am I going to rely on if I lose my head again? Hahaha!
