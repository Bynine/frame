Siiigh...
[ANIM_3]What?! What do you want?!
[ANIM_3]I have no time for little people in funny clothes! I am frustrated!
[ANIM_0]In the past beautiful tall flowers bloomed all around Wabika. [ANIM_3]Now there are none! None at all!
[ANIM_0]I thought the beach would be a good change of pace, but even the sea does not inspire me...
[ANIM_0]What am I to do without my muse?...
[ANIM_3]Are you still here?! Leave me in my sorrow, interloper!
&TALK_ARTIST
[ANIM_0]I miss those tall, gorgeous flowers... With all my heart, I miss them.
[ANIM_0]How can a painter paint without their muse? [ANIM_3]Tell me, is it possible? No![ANIM_0]

My friend... THANKS_LINE.
You are truly kind to grow flowers in this forest. As I walked around in frustration, I saw you doing so.
I was so touched by this gesture that I painted you tending to one of the flowers.
Please, accept it. It is the least I can do.
[NOSPEAKER][GIVE_TREASURE5]You received a painting!
I would paint closer to your flowers, but... [PAUSE][ANIM_6]my easel got caught in the sand! Hahaha!ARTIST_TREASURE

I am so inspired... [ANIM_6]I will paint all the time!
[ANIM_5]However, something still sours my mood. My ...[ANIM_6][PAUSE] uh, friend, Jackie, who runs the cafe in the village...
[ANIM_5]She is so busy lately that we haven't had the chance to talk.
I hope she can get some time off soon. She works very hard, you know.
&WORLD_REWARD,CAFE_REWARD
Now that I am inspired... I will paint, paint, paint!
[ANIM_6]I will never stop! Hahahaha!
[ANIM_1]I hope you will see my paintings around Wabika. I am quite proud of them.

Ah, I see a glint in your eyes! You have made some great progress, haven't you?
[ANIM_6]Wonderful! I figured you would! Hahaha!
