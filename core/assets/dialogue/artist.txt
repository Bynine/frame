[ANIM_3]What?! What do you want?!
I have no time for little people in funny clothes! I am frustrated!
[ANIM_0]In the past beautiful tall flowers bloomed all around Wabika. Now there are none! None at all!
What am I to do without my muse?! 
[ANIM_3]Are you still here?! Leave me in my sorrow, interloper!

I miss those tall, gorgeous flowers... With all my heart, I miss them.
How can a painter paint without their muse? [ANIM_3]Tell me, is it possible? No!

My friend... THANKS_LINE.
You are truly kind to grow flowers in this forest. As I walked, I saw you doing so.
I was so touched by this gesture that I painted you tending to one of the flowers.
Please, accept it. It is the least I can do.
[NOSPEAKER][GIVE_TREASURE5]You received a painting!
&WORLD_REWARD
Now that I am inspired... I will paint, paint, paint!
I will never stop! Hahahaha!
