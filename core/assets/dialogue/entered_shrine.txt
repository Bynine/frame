Congratulations on making it this far, traveller from another land.
Your searching ability is clearly excellent. Next, it is your compassion I will test.
Go back out into the land and look for those whose hearts are ailing.
Bring back proof of the compassion you have brought to these denizens... 
Then you may find what you are searching for.
