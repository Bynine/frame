Congratulations on making it this far, traveller from another land.
Your searching ability is clearly excellent. Next, it is your compassion I will test.
Go back out into Wabika and look for those whose hearts are ailing.
Bring back proof of the compassion you have shown to these denizens... 
Then you may find what you are searching for.
