[NOSPEAKER][GIVE_GOAL]You obtained the Seed of Hope!
Congratulations, traveller. You have reached the end of my trials and proven yourself thoroughly.
What will you do now? Will you remain in Wabika, or return to your home and use what you've found?
Whatever the case... you are welcome to stay here whenever you like.
[PAUSE]I thank you sincerely for all that you've done.
