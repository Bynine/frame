*TALK_FREBKING
[SPEED=2]YOU SPEAK TO THE FREB KING.
[NEWNAME=Freb King][SPEED=2]UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN DARK TIMES. NUM_FREBS_WITHOUT_SHELLS OF MY SUBJECTS ARE WITHOUT SHELLS TO WEAR.
[SPEED=2]IT IS A MOST HORRID FATE FOR A FREB TO BE WITHOUT A SHELL. IT CANNOT EVEN SING FROM THE SHAME.
[SPEED=2]I WOULD HELP THEM MYSELF, BUT...[PAUSE] I HAVE GROWN TOO LARGE TO EXIT MY SHELL. IT IS VERY EMBARASSING.
[SPEED=2]IF YOU WERE TO HELP MY SUBJECTS AND FIND THEM SHELLS TO WEAR... YOU WOULD BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY.
&TALK_FREBKING
[SPEED=2]NUM_FREBS_WITHOUT_SHELLS OF MY SUBJECTS ARE STILL WITHOUT SHELLS TO WEAR.
[SPEED=2]THEY USUALLY SIT BY THE WATER. PLEASE, SAVE THEM FROM THEIR SHAME. MY HEART WEEPS FOR THEM...

[SPEED=2]NO, TINY CHAMPION. YOUR NOBLE DEEDS HAVE FILLED ME WITH JOY. MY SUBJECTS NOW SING WITH GLEE.
[SPEED=2]HERE IS YOUR REWARD. PLEASE, KNOW THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE CELEBRATED BY FREBKIND.
[GIVE_TREASURE1][NOSPEAKER]You received the Golden Shell!
[SPEED=2]THIS BEAUTIFUL SHELL IS UNFORTUNATELY TOO HEAVY FOR ANY FREB TO WEAR. MAYBE YOU CAN USE IT.
[TALK][SPEED=2]HM? WAS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANTED?
[SPEED=2]AHHH... I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT TREASURE SINCE I WAS BUT A TADPOLE.
[SPEED=2]IF I RECALL, THE GOD OF THIS LAND CREATED SUCH A THING A LONG TIME AGO.
[SPEED=2]MANY HAVE TRIED TO OBTAIN IT AND FAILED.
[SPEED=2]IF YOU WISH TO DO SO... I CAN ONLY SAY GOOD LUCK, AND KEEP A STRONG HEART.
&FREBKING_REWARD
[SPEED=2]BY THE WAY... HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND, GRUB MOTHER?
[SPEED=2]SHE USED TO COME HERE EVERY SO OFTEN WITH HER CHILDREN, BUT I'VE NOT SEEN HER RECENTLY.
[SPEED=2]I HOPE SHE IS DOING OKAY...
&GRUB_REWARD,FREBKING_REWARD
