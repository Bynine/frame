[SPEED=2]YOU SPEAK TO THE FREB KING.
[NEWNAME=Freb King][SPEED=2]UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN DARK TIMES. NUM_FREBS_WITHOUT_SHELLS OF MY SUBJECTS ARE WITHOUT SHELLS TO WEAR.
[SPEED=2]IT IS A MOST HORRID FATE FOR A FREB TO BE WITHOUT A SHELL. IT CANNOT EVEN SING FROM THE SHAME.
[SPEED=2]I WOULD HELP THEM MYSELF, BUT...[PAUSE] I HAVE GROWN TOO LARGE TO EXIT MY SHELL. IT IS VERY EMBARASSING.
[SPEED=2]IF YOU WERE TO HELP MY SUBJECTS AND FIND THEM SHELLS TO WEAR... YOU WOULD BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY.
