[SPEED=4]GREETINGS, TINY ONE... YOU SPEAK TO THE FREB KING.
[SPEED=4]UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN DARK TIMES. NUM_FREBS_WITHOUT_SHELLS OF MY SUBJECTS ARE WITHOUT SHELLS TO WEAR.
[SPEED=4]IT IS A MOST HORRID FATE FOR A FREB TO BE WITHOUT A SHELL. IT CANNOT EVEN SING FROM THE SHAME.
[SPEED=4]IF YOU WERE TO HELP MY SUBJECTS AND FIND THEM SHELLS TO WEAR... YOU WOULD BE REWARDED HANDSOMELY.

[SPEED=4]HELLO AGAIN, TINY ONE... NUM_FREBS_WITHOUT_SHELLS OF MY SUBJECTS ARE STILL WITHOUT SHELLS TO WEAR.
[SPEED=4]THEY USUALLY SIT BY THE WATER. PLEASE, SAVE THEM FROM THEIR SHAME.
