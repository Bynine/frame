It's good to see you... How have you been?
[TALK][PAUSE]...Ahh, is that so.[ANIM_3] I hope that thing you found is helping you out.
[ANIM_0]Listen... [PAUSE][ANIM_2]Things haven't been great here lately.
This winter has lasted abnormally long, and it hasn't shown any signs of stopping. We can't grow anything. People are...
...[PAUSE][ANIM_0]Oh! That's right! I hate to ask, but could you please do me a favor?
It's Codsworth. He went up to his store a while back to go investigate this bizarre weather. To see if it can be stopped, you know?
[ANIM_2]He's not so great at taking care of himself, so... [ANIM_0][GIVE_FOOD]I was hoping you could bring him this.
I'll compensate you any way I can. [ANIM_3]You're a true friend.

Glad you're still doing well. It's bitterly cold out there!
Still, I'm worried about Codsworth. What could be keeping him...?

Any news of Codsworth?
[TALK][PAUSE]...[ANIM_3]Hahaha, I'm sure he needs the rest. Now that he's full up he'll be fine to make the trek back here once he awakens.
You're an invaluable ally. How can I repay you... [ANIM_0]Oh, how about this?
[GIVE_HAMMER]My trusty old hammer. I've been seeing unnaturally thick ice crop up all over the place. This should help you out.

Looks like I'll have to go back out soon and chop some more firewood for the stove.
To keep the people safe, I'll have to keep trying my best. Just seeing you here has re-energized me, at least!
