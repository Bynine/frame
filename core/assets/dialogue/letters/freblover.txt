Dearest Venturer,
	Salutations! I hope this missive finds you in excellent health. Thanks to your most cordial assistance, I was able to meticulously observe the singularly delightful singing patterns of the common Freb. 
Their sultry tones are sublime, exquisite even, exceeding the capacity of the 
world's finest composers. 
Your actions are that of a true hero.
Sincerely, Freb Lover
