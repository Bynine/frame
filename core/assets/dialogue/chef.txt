[ANIM_1]I'm so sorry this place is such a mess... Those little rapscallions, you know...
Either way, please, make yourself at home! The stew should be done before too long.
By the way... Are you related to the tall gentleman who's staying with us? Your clothes look awfully similar...

[ANIM_1]Feel free to stay here. Our home is your home.
By the way... did you know my apron was made by the tailor here in town? Pretty neat, huh?

It came out great, don't you think? I feel like something happened while it was cooking...
Like the world became a little better.

By the way, that tall person who was staying with us left.
They said something about returning home.
I hope their travels go well... and I hope staying here helped them out, even if just a bit.
My stew has that effect on people, you know! Haha!
