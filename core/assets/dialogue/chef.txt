Oh, I'm so sorry this place is such a mess... Those little rapscallions, you know...
Please, make yourself at home! The stew is on, it should be done before too long.

Feel free to stay here. Our home is your home.
Say, your clothes look kind of like those of that tall person's who's staying with us. Are you two related?

It came out great, don't you think? I feel like something happened while it was cooking...
Like the world became a little better.

By the way, that tall person who was staying with us left.
They said something about returning home.
I hope their travels go well... and I hope staying here helped them out, even if just a bit.
My stew has that effect on people, you know! Haha!
