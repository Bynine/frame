[ANIM_1]I'm so sorry this place is such a mess... Those little rapscallions, you know...
Either way, please, make yourself at home! The stew should be done before too long.
By the way... Are you related to the tall gentleman who's staying with us? Your clothes look awfully similar...
&TALK_CHEF
[ANIM_1]Feel free to stay here. Our home is your home.
By the way... did you know my apron was made by the tailor here in town? Pretty neat, huh?
&TALK_CHEF,!GRUB_REWARD
[ANIM_1]Feel free to stay here. Our home is your home.
By the way... Have you met the tailor? Is she doing okay? I haven't seen her around in a while.
Hope she's all right. [ANIM_0]I'll check up on her as soon as I'm done with this soup...

It came out great, don't you think? I feel like something happened while it was cooking...
Like the world became a little better.
[PAUSE]Or maybe I'm just crazy. [ANIM_3]Haha! Enjoy the stew!

By the way, that tall person who was staying with us left.
They said something about returning home.
I hope their travels go well... and I hope staying here helped them out, even if just a bit.
[ANIM_3]My stew has that effect on people, you know! Haha!
&FOUND_GOAL,!GRUB_REWARD
It came out pretty well, I think. But, still...
[ANIM_2]I hope the tailor's doing okay. I think I saw her kids running out West earlier.
