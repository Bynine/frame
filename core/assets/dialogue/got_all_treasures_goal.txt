Traveller... You have truly gone above and beyond.
Did you really come here just to obtain the Seed of Hope?
Or was it because you want to help those who are suffering? To me it seems this is your true intention.
Either way... while there are no more treasures tucked away in this land...
I hope you will come back some day.
