That outfit... You're from the West too, aren't you?
You did well to leave that place. It gets worse there every day.
Take my advice; never go back.

Never go back West... Only a fool would.
I'm lucky that I managed to escape. Wabika is a far gentler place.

The people here... They're very hospitable.
It is certainly much better here than the West. Much kinder.
Yet... I can't help but feel a certain guilt.
Perhaps I should return home and try to take care of those I knew, the best I can...

It is a dilemma, to be sure...
Do you have people that you love?
Make sure you talk to them when you can. It's so easy to lose contact.
So easy...
