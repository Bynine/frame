Hello there, stranger!
You must be new around here. Welcome to the humble land of Wabika.
Say, could I ask you a favor? Lately this place hasn't had many visitors.
If you do leave back to where you came from, could you tell them of this place?
And... maybe mention this shop, too. Hehe.
How does that sound?
